# Lab 08 - Smoking during pregnancy

_Due Monday April 18 by 5:00pm_

Work through Lab 08 at: [https://stat408-s22.github.io/labs/lab-08/lab-08-inference-smoking.html](https://stat408-s22.github.io/labs/lab-08/lab-08-inference-smoking.html) (also linked off of our [course calendar webpage](https://stat408-s22.github.io/calendar.html)). 

You will work on this lab in teams. 
The lab will guide you through cloning your team's Lab 08 repo (named `lab-08-inference-smoking-YOUR_TEAM_NAME`) from our [GitHub stat408-s22 organization](https://github.com/stat408-s22), adding your lab answers to the starter `lab-08.Rmd` file in your repo, knitting to a markdown (.md) file, then pushing your changes to GitHub. Your team's final answers -- both .Rmd and .md files -- should be pushed to GitHub prior to the due date. Labs will be graded in GitHub.
